                    <p>
                        Applying genomic tools and techniques to understand genetic diversity, population structure,
                        and adaptive potential in threatened and endangered species. This research helps inform
                        evidence-based conservation strategies and management decisions.

                    <p>
                        Investigating genetic variation within and among populations to understand evolutionary
                        processes, gene flow patterns, and the impacts of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity.
                        This work is crucial for maintaining healthy, viable populations.

                    <p>
                        Using genomic data to assess biodiversity at multiple scales, from genes to ecosystems.
                        This research aims to identify priority areas for conservation and understand the genomic
                        basis of species' responses to environmental change.

                    <h3>Wildlife Genomics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Developing and applying genomic methods to study wildlife populations, including population
                        monitoring, kinship analysis, and identifying adaptive genetic variation. These tools help
                        track species' responses to environmental pressures and inform recovery programs.

                <h2>Research Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    My work combines field ecology, laboratory genomics, and computational biology to address
                    fundamental questions in conservation science. I collaborate with conservation practitioners,
                    wildlife managers, and local communities to ensure research outcomes have real-world impact.
